      <h2>From a weekly prayer to a community home</h2>
      <p>
        The need for a place of worship in Guildford became clear in 2008, when
        local brothers began holding Jumu’ah at the Guildford Library. As the
        community grew, volunteers secured a small musallah and later moved to
        the current centre on 103A Avenue in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, GICC hosts the five daily prayers, Jumu’ah, Qur’an and Islamic
        studies, youth programs, family activities, and community support. Our
        congregation represents the many cultures and backgrounds that make
        Guildford and Surrey home.
      </p>
      <h2>Our purpose</h2>
      <p>
        We work to preserve Islamic identity, nurture a viable Muslim community,
        and promote a comprehensive Islamic way of life based on the Qur’an and
        the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        GICC is not only a mosque. It is a community centre for everyone.
